# Better Vendor Price
Better Vendor Price WoW addon

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mooreatv/BetterVendorPrice/master/sample.png">

Shows per individual, current stack and full stack prices.

Works anywhere including bags, vendors, item links in chat and the Auction House.

Has configuration options to tweak the display from 1 to 3 lines + AHDB info or not, using Shift key or not: `/bvp config`

(check the different views and stack info using shift and not in the config)

## Background/Why is it useful?
Sometimes the regular vendor price isn't enough to decide what to keep and what to discard:

For instance imagine you have 4 something that sell for 12s and 2 of something else for for 8s and both are dropping right now

Well assuming they both stack in 5 max, you should get rid of the 4 as you can get 20s from that slot with the other item (vs 15s for the other)

But if one stacks in 20 and the other in 5 or 10, the calculation changes !

Unless you are a math wiz and can do all that in your head (and if you know the stacking size), you can use this addon to guide you! (and if a math wiz, it'll tell you the stacking size too which you can't know otherwise)

## More info
Works for both Dragonflight and WoW Classic (Era, SoM, TBC, and now Wrath of the Lich King where it's even more useful given lack of default vendor price)
